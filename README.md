# Booking.com Hotel Scraper üè®

## Overview
A Python script that automatically scrapes 5-star hotels in Cairo from Booking.com, including:
- Hotel name
- Location
- Price
- Rating
- Review count
- Booking link

Saves all data to a CSV file with automatic pagination handling.

- Runs in background without GUI (configurable)
- Simulates real user behavior

üìä **Structured Output**  
- Clean CSV format with proper columns
- Handles missing data gracefully

   - Navigates to provided Booking.com URL

2. **Content Loading**:
   - Scrolls to page bottom repeatedly
   - Clicks "Load more results" when available
   - Waits between actions to prevent blocking

3. **Data Extraction**:
   - Parses loaded HTML with BeautifulSoup
   - Extracts hotel details from property cards
   - Handles missing data fields gracefully

4. **Output**:
   - Saves all data to CSV
   - Preserves special characters with UTF-8 encoding
